[input_shaper]
#shaper_freq_x: 0
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for X axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of X axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI
#   input shapers, this parameter can be set from different
#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for X axis.
#shaper_freq_y: 0
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for Y axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of Y axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI
#   input shapers, this parameter can be set from different
#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for Y axis.
#shaper_type: mzv
#   A type of the input shaper to use for both X and Y axes. Supported
#   shapers are zv, mzv, zvd, ei, 2hump_ei, and 3hump_ei. The default
#   is mzv input shaper.
#shaper_type_x:
#shaper_type_y:
#   If shaper_type is not set, these two parameters can be used to
#   configure different input shapers for X and Y axes. The same
#   values are supported as for shaper_type parameter.
#damping_ratio_x: 0.1
#damping_ratio_y: 0.1
#   Damping ratios of vibrations of X and Y axes used by input shapers
#   to improve vibration suppression. Default value is 0.1 which is a
#   good all-round value for most printers. In most circumstances this
#   parameter requires no tuning and should not be changed.

cs_pin:
#   The SPI enable pin for the sensor. This parameter must be provided.
#spi_speed: 5000000
#   The SPI speed (in hz) to use when communicating with the chip.
#   The default is 5000000.
#spi_bus:
#spi_software_sclk_pin:
#spi_software_mosi_pin:
#spi_software_miso_pin:
#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#axes_map: x, y, z
#   The accelerometer axis for each of the printer's X, Y, and Z axes.
#   This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
#   orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
#   example, one could set this to "y, x, z" to swap the X and Y axes.
#   It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
#   direction is reversed (eg, "x, z, -y"). The default is "x, y, z".
#rate: 3200
#   Output data rate for ADXL345. ADXL345 supports the following data
#   rates: 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25. Note that it is
#   not recommended to change this rate from the default 3200, and
#   rates below 800 will considerably affect the quality of resonance
#   measurements.
